# Advent of Code 2022

Every day I chose to use a random language decided by https://perchance.org/programming-languge <br>

Day 1: Perl (Originally I rolled Objective-C but could not figure out how to compile it) <br>
Day 2: C# <br>
Day 3: Rust <br>
Day 4: FORTH (I gave up here due to difficulty and lack of time)
